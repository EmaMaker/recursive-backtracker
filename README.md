Recursive Backtracker

In this repository there are various implementations of the Recursive Backtracker Maze Generation algorithm, explained at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_backtracker

In this branch: Same as master branch, but there's no animation. Also the walls are not lines anymore but they're considered like cells. There's a red rectangle that can be moved around the maze with the arrow keys. Used as a starting point for the C Console implementation
